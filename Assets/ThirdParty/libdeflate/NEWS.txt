Version 0.8:
	Build fixes for certain platforms and compilers.

	libdeflate now produces the same output on all CPU architectures.

	Improved documentation for building libdeflate on Windows.

Version 0.7:
	Fixed a very rare bug that caused data to be compressed incorrectly.
	The bug affected compression levels 7 and below since libdeflate v0.2.
	Although there have been no user reports of the bug, and I believe it
	would have been highly unlikely to encounter on realistic data, it could
	occur on data specially crafted to reproduce it.

	Fixed a compilation error when building with clang 3.7.

Version 0.6:
	Various improvements to the gzip program's behavior.

	Faster CRC-32 on AVX-capable processors.

	Other minor changes.

Version 0.5:
	The CRC-32 checksum algorithm has been optimized with carryless
	multiplication instructions for x86_64 (PCLMUL).  This speeds up gzip
	compression and decompression.

	Build fixes for certain platforms and compilers.

	Added more test programs and scripts.

	libdeflate is now entirely MIT-licensed.

Version 0.4:
	The Adler-32 checksum algorithm has been optimized with vector
	instructions for x86_64 (SSE2 and AVX2) and ARM (NEON).  This speeds up
	zlib compression and decompression.

	To avoid naming collisions, functions and definitions in libdeflate's
	API have been renamed to be prefixed with "libdeflate_" or
	"LIBDEFLATE_".  Programs using the old API will need to be updated.

	Various bug fixes and other improvements.

Version 0.3:
	Some bug fixes and other minor changes.

Version 0.2:
	Implemented a new block splitting algorithm which typically improves the
	compression ratio slightly at all compression levels.

	The compressor now outputs each block using the cheapest type (dynamic
	Huffman, static Huffman, or uncompressed).

	The gzip program has received an overhaul and now behaves more like the
	standard version.

	Build system updates, including: some build options were changed and
	some build options were removed, and the default 'make' target now
	includes the gzip program as well as the library.

Version 0.1:
	Initial official release.
